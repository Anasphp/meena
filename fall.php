                    <p>This sophisticated mixed container for shade is composed of fern, a white variegated caladium, bronzy-purple Iresine, and white torenia. The glazed pattern of the pot adds to the rhythm of the rounded foliage.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>Evergreen & Autumn Mix</h4>
                    <p>The evergreens in this fall container will last all winter long. Fernspray Gold Hinoki cypress has beautiful yellow and green foliage that stands out against the deep bold mondo grass. Add bright pansies in the gold and crimson shades of autumn and a gourd or mini squash for extra fall charm. Change out the look for Christmas by replacing the gourd with a red ornament at Christmas.</p>

                    <h4>Glitter and Gold</h4>

                    <h4>Fall Color All Season</h4>
                    <p>For instant fall color gratification use croton (typically sold as a houseplant), a mum or two, ornamental peppers and golden variegated ivy. It will provide fall interest all season long.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Mums and Cabbage</h4>
                    <p>Mums are the quintessential autumn plant, providing rich tones of bronze, red, gold and lavender. The flowering cabbages at the along the walkway edges provide textural contrast.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Beautiful Companions</h4>
                    <p>Herbs make beautiful companions. African basil provides a bit of lavender color, scented geranium leaves provide texture and great scent, and a variegated mint spills down the side. For added color and contrast a yellow calibrachoa has been tucked in. All combine beautifully for a useful and beautiful container garden.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Colorful Foliage Mix</h4>
                    <p>Colorful foliage doesn't have to come from trees! Coral bells (Heuchera) provide rich leaf colors for fall. Set off dark-leaved coral bells with the brighter foliage of variegated sage and euphorbia as your see here. The burnished tones of the ornamental grass, Carex, add to the autumn feel.</p>
